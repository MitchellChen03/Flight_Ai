Team Lead Project: United Airlines Flight Delay Prediction Model

A comprehensive machine learning solution that predicts departure delays for United Airlines flights with 73.9% accuracy using advanced feature engineering and ensemble modeling techniques.

Project Overview

As the Team Lead, I led the development of a production-ready machine learning model that analyzes historical flight data, weather conditions, and operational patterns to predict United Airlines departure delays. The project demonstrates expertise in data science, machine learning, and full-stack development.
